        <p>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for web development within the confines of HTML. However, the majority of our JavaScript course will be dedicated to JavaScript learning frameworks, which aren’t solely confined to HTML.  JavaScript programming is generally used to process code directly in the web browser, instead of a web server. Students who learn how to code in JavaScript will be able to create simple to complex web pages, add interactivity features to an existing site, and update pages quickly without reloading.</p>
        <p>It’s necessary for most mobile and web developers to learn JavaScript since it’s the only programming language understood by all web browsers and is one of the most popular script languages today.</p>
